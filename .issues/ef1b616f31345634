When an issue id is mentioned in a commit message, the text of the
message should be added as a comment to the issue (prior to the
commit).

Similarly the subjects of the issues (with their ids) should be added
to the initial commit message given by mercurial in the editor. They
should appear in the ignored lines of the message (lines starting with
HG, so that the user is reminded what issue each id stands for.
